        <h1>Title: Movie Directory</h1>
        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>This project will be a web application that allows users to find information about movies (e.g. movies, directors, genres etc). To this end, I will be building a REST API that interacts with a movies database to get relevant movie information.</p>
