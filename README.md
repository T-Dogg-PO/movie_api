# myFlix API
As part of my larger 'myFlix' project (a website designed to be a movie database, similar to [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)), this is the backend logic primarily built using Node.js.

## Purpose
The purpose of the myFlix site is to get exposure to and practice using the full MERN stack, building a full stack website in the process. This part in particular is the backend logic, where the database models are defined as well as the server/API logic.

## Technologies Used
